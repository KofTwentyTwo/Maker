# Maker

## Development 

### Overview
Makers is a Web Application with a strict seperation from Front-End and Back-End.  

The front-end of Makers is a React WebPack HTML5 Application. 

The back-end of Makers is a Java Springs Application.  

The development environment does it's best to make the entire stack work as a single deplorable application with little needed from the developer, however this is not always the case.   The below will endevor to declare the proper development environment and it's setup, allowing for a "Nice and Easy" developer experience.

##### Database
Storage is provided by a MySQL Database.   For local development, the recommendation is a local mysql running via Docker 

### Building and Running Things Manually 

#### The Front-End
The front-end can be initially build and ran from the command line via a couple of simple Yarn commands. 

##### Getting The Modules
Installing the modules needed for the system is as simple as running `yarn install`
The output should look close to this 

        ‚ûú  Maker git:(master) ‚úó yarn install      
        yarn install v1.17.3
        [1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
        [2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
        [3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
        [4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
        ‚ú®  Done in 3.82s.
        ‚ûú  Maker git:(master) ‚úó         

##### Running The Frontend Dev Server
Once you have all of the modules installed and happy, running the live-reload frontend development server is as simple as 
running `yarn start-dev` which should then looks like this 
        
        ‚ûú  Maker git:(master) ‚úó yarn start-dev
        
        yarn run v1.17.3
        $ webpack-dev-server --color --mode development

At this point the server is running and it should have opened your local browser and will be showing you the contents of the 
dist directory.  The options that control the behavior of the webpack-development server are found in two places in your config. 

1. webpack.config.js
2. package.json

webpack.config.js contains a `devServer` section which outlines the configuration for the server that you are starting 
 
           devServer:
           {
              contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
              compress: true,
              port: 9001,
              open: true,
              liveReload: true
           }, 

package.json contains the definition of the script (which is what you are calling on the command line with the Yarn command 
above `yarn start-dev`) and also defines the few parameters which can not be defined in the configuration file

         "scripts": {
              "start-dev":   "webpack-dev-server --color --mode development"
           },

#### The Back-End 
The backend of the server is a Java Spring application which provides a series of RestAPI endpoints for the front-end of the 
application to interact with.  The manual build environment for the backend is a provided by Maven.
